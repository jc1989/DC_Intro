        <h1>Introduction Website</h1>
        <h2>Made by Josh Cannedy</h2>
        <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Josh Cannedy, and I'm really excited to be here at DigitalCrafts! I'm so excited that I made this website in my spare time so that I could help show you more about myself!</p>
        <p>Before finding the great people here @ DigitalCrafts, I was in the Marine Corps. I served for 4 years as an infantryman and was lucky enough to be stationed in Hawaii where I met my beautiful wife, Luvianca.</p>
        <p>After serving my enlistment, I enrolled at lonestar, and then at DeVry University in pursuit of a degree in CIS with a concentration in Software Programming.</p>
        <p>My interests include:</P> 
            <ul>
                <li>Computers</li>
                <li>Programming</li>
                <li>Working Out</li>
                <li>Mountain Biking</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Oh, and somewhere along the way we picked up this fur ball. :)</p>
